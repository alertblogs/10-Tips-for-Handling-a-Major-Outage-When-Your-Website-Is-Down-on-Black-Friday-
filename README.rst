10 Tips for Handling a Major Outage (When Your Website Is Down on Black Friday)
========

 
If your e-commerce website is down due to a Black Friday major outage, are you prepared to handle it? Customers demand exceptional digital retail experiences on Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and throughout the holidays. If your company can manage issues that can cause an e-commerce outage, it can limit their impact now and in the future.

Ultimately, we want to help your team handle major incidents. To accomplish our goal, we want to teach you about the impact of e-commerce system outages so you can effectively manage an e-commerce outage or even prevent one from happening in the first place.

Impact of a Black Friday E-Commerce Outage
====
Online sales are projected to increase between 17% and 22% in 2020, according to Deloitte. This may be due in part to fear associated with the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, which is driving more consumers to forgo brick-and-mortar retailers, and instead, purchase holiday gifts online. It may also be linked to the rising use of technology to shop from virtually anywhere, at any time.

Meanwhile, the cost of an outage — particularly on Black Friday — can be significant. IDC research indicates the average cost of an infrastructure failure among Fortune 1000 organizations is approximately $100,000 per hour. Furthermore, the average cost of unplanned downtime among these organizations falls between $1.25 billion and $2.5 billion annually.

If your business experiences a Black Friday e-commerce outage, the damage can be substantial in terms of revenue losses. In the short-term, the outage will hamper your company’s ability to engage with online shoppers on the busiest shopping day of the year. This can cause your company to miss out on revenues — and lose these revenues to its rivals.

Issues That Can Cause a Black Friday E-Commerce Outage
=====
Common causes of IT outages include:
1. Cyberattacks
====
Ransomware, malware, and other cyber threats are major problems for global organizations. If cybercriminals attack an e-commerce website, they can gain control of the site and shut it down.
2. Power or Internet Issues
====
A power or internet outage can cause an e-commerce site to go offline. This can occur if a company does not have backups in place to maintain consistent power or internet connectivity.

3. Hardware Failure
====
Hardware that is not properly maintained can cause an e-commerce outage. If a company does not have hardware redundancies in place, it is ill-equipped to stop e-commerce outages, too.

In addition to the aforementioned causes, there are several factors that can contribute to an e-commerce outage, such as:

    Sluggish third-party apps and APIs
    Graphics-intensive web pages
    Failure to inspect website performance at regional and national levels
    Human error
    Poor infrastructure

Regardless of why an e-commerce outage occurs, it is crucial to act quickly to mitigate the issue. By leveraging a best-in-class incident management and response platform, your company can limit the impact of an e-commerce outage and uncover ways to prevent IT outages.
